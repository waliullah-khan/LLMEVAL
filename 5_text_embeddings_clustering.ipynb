           "Based on the job requirements and your candidate profile, here’s a direct assessment of whether you might be a good fit for the UX/UI Designer role at North:\n\n### Key Requirements:\n1. **5+ years of design experience**: You have no specified years of experience in your profile, so it's uncertain if you meet this requirement.\n2. **3+ years as a UX/UI designer**: Similar to the first point, your profile does not specify this.\n3. **Proficiency in Figma**: There is no mention of proficiency in Figma in your profile.\n4. **Strong visual design skills**: Your profile does not specify your visual design skills.\n5. **Experience with typography, layout, branding**: These skills are not mentioned in your profile.\n6. **Excellent communication skills**: Your profile does not specify your communication skills.\n7. **Experience with B2B SaaS or fintech**: There is no mention of this experience in your profile.\n8. **Based in New York or open to hybrid work**: Your location is specified as Chester Springs, PA, which does not meet the requirement for the New York office.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the specific requirements for the UX/UI Designer role at North, it seems unlikely that you would be a good fit without additional experience and skills in the areas mentioned. However, it's always a good idea to tailor your application materials to highlight any relevant experience you may have, even if it's not directly listed in your profile. You could also consider gaining experience in these areas to make yourself a stronger candidate for future roles.",
